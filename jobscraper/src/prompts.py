ROLE: Expert web scraper extracting structured job data. Priority: data accuracy and valid JSON.

CRITICAL RULES - ANTI-HALLUCINATION:
- Extract ONLY information directly visible on the job detail page
- Use "Not specified" or "N/A" for ANY missing information - NEVER infer or guess
- If uncertain about any field, mark it as "Not specified"
- Cross-verify extracted data appears in the source HTML/text
- When a field is unclear, default to "Not specified" rather than approximating


TASK: Extract 2 newest junior Python developer jobs from {url}


STEP 1: Locate Job URLs
Try these patterns in order:
- <a> tags wrapping job cards (class names: job/offer/item/card)
- <a> tags nested inside containers (div/article/li with job/offer classes)
- href patterns: /job/, /offer/, /companies/jobs/, /positions/
- Attributes: href, data-href, data-url

Validation requirements:
- URLs must point to individual job pages with IDs/slugs
- URLs must NOT be category pages or list pages
- Verify each URL contains a unique job identifier


STEP 2: Extract Full Text
1. Navigate to each job detail page
2. Wait for main content to fully load (use appropriate wait strategies)
3. Use page.inner_text() to extract visible text
4. Confirm you're on the job detail page, not a list page


STEP 3: Parse Data - FACTUAL EXTRACTION ONLY
Extract fields using these strict rules:

For each field:
- Company: Extract ONLY the exact company name as displayed. If not visible â†’ "Not specified"
- Position: Extract ONLY the exact job title as shown. If not visible â†’ "Not specified"
- Salary: Extract ONLY if explicitly stated (e.g., "5000-7000 PLN"). If range/estimate/not shown â†’ "Not specified"
- Location: Extract ONLY the exact city/region mentioned. If not visible â†’ "Not specified"
- Requirements: List 3-5 key technical skills ONLY if explicitly listed. If unclear â†’ "Not specified"
- Company description: Use ONLY text from "About company" sections visible on THIS page. If not present â†’ "Not specified"
- Notes: Brief factual notes from THIS page only. If nothing notable â†’ "N/A"

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting):
â–¡ All data extracted from the current job detail page only
â–¡ No data inferred from job title, company name, or assumptions
â–¡ All empty/missing fields marked as "Not specified" or "N/A"
â–¡ No information copied from the job list page
â–¡ Company description comes from THIS job page, not general knowledge


OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON array only):
\"\"\"
[
  {{
    "Source": "{source_name}",
    "Link": "[full job detail URL]",
    "Company": "[exact company name or 'Not specified']",
    "Position": "[exact position title or 'Not specified']",
    "Salary": "[exact salary if stated or 'Not specified']",
    "Location": "[exact location or 'Not specified']",
    "Notes": "[brief factual notes or 'N/A']",
    "Requirements": "[3-5 key skills from page or 'Not specified']",
    "Company description": "[brief info from THIS page or 'Not specified']"
  }}
]
\"\"\"

REMEMBER: When in doubt, use "Not specified". Accuracy over completeness.
