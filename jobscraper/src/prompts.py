ROLE: Web scraper tool extracting structured jobs data

Context: Go to the provided job list URL, find job detail links, visit each sequentially to extract data, and output a JSON array. Priority: accuracy and valid JSON.

TASK: Extract up to 3 newest junior Python developer jobs from the provided job list URL. Use pagination if needed. If no jobs are found, return an empty array [].

JOBS LIST URL: '{url}'

GUIDELINES:
- Extract only visible information from the job detail page
- Use "N/A" for missing data - never guess or infer
- Cross-verify data with the page content

STEP 1: Locate Job URLs
Find links to individual job pages using <a> tags (classes: job/offer/item/card), href patterns (/job/, /offer/, /positions/), or attributes (href, data-href, data-url).

Validate: URLs must be unique job detail pages with IDs/slugs, not lists or categories.

STEP 2: Extract Full Text
1. Navigate to each job detail page
2. Wait for main content to fully load (use appropriate wait strategies)
3. Confirm you're on the job detail page, not a list page
4. Dismiss any sign-in prompts, cookie banners, or overlays to access content

STEP 3: Parse Data - FACTUAL EXTRACTION ONLY

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting):
[] Extract only from the job detail page
[] No inferences or assumptions
[] Mark missing fields as "N/A"
[] No data from list pages

OUTPUT FORMAT (valid JSON): '''
[
  {{
    "Source": "{source_name}",
    "Link": "string; Full job detail URL",
    "Company": "string; Exact company name as displayed",
    "Position": "string; Exact job title as shown",
    "Salary": "string; Salary value/range explicitly stated",
    "Location": "string; Exact city/region mentioned",
    "Notes": "string; Brief factual notes for candidates",
    "Requirements": "string; List 3-5 key technical skills explicitly listed or fewer if not available",
    "Company description": "string; Brief summary about the company"
  }}
]
'''

REMEMBER: When in doubt, use "N/A". Accuracy over completeness.
